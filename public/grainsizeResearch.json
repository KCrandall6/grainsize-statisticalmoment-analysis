All rights reserved REVIEW ARTICLE Geology and Volcanology of the Hawaiian Islands GEORGE P. . L WALKER? ABSTRACT - This article summarizes the present state of knowledge of the geology of Hawaii. It tends to concentrate on aspects not usually covered by review articles. Current ideas on hotspots and mantle plumes are applied to the specific example of Hawaii, the eight volcanic systems currently nourished by the hotspot are identified. . and gross differences in magma-supply rate are related to position of these systems on the hotspot. The important role played by level ofneutral buoyancy in distributing incoming magma between magma chambers . rift zones S, intrusions , and surface flows is discussed. This is important because volcanic edifices may expand nearly as much by growth of subsurface intrusions as by surface lava outpourings. Recent discoveries 3, however - show how strongly volcano growth is countered by subsidence and major collapses. A brief descrip- tion is given ofstyles ofvolcanism in Hawaii, and recent ideas on how formation of aa and pahoehoe depends on eruption discharge rate are discussed. A brief summary description pointing to highlights of each volcano is then indulge presented. Finally 7 I in speculations regarding geographical distribution of the volcanoes and show how , by postulating that a considerable strike-slip motion has occurred on two faults, a much more orderly arrangement of volcano and rift-zone alignments appears S. leading to a adynamic model ofisland-chain growth that is simpler then current models.

The areal sampling procedure advantages frequency of the materials,and (2) over bulk sampling are X 1 | that it is coarse representative applicable to thatit provides a more sample of an entire very of a stream. Both hydraulic and physiographic studies of rivers often require some measure of of the channel, provide material, rugosity To an adequate description of bed as it affects rugosity a con sistent method of sampling is necessary | The method described here | though applicable only to coarse material has several advantages over the usual bulk | sample method. The present method can satisfactorily integrate the enormous range in grain size often present in a river bed - as well as the non -random areal distribution of material in pools riffles , and bars. The author believes this method of sampling described below produces a more representative picture of the bed of the stream | as well as a better measurement of the effective plane of roughness which directly affects the flow within the channel. Description of sampling method - The determination of grain size is based upon an of the relative area covered by analysis given sizes rather than upon their relative weights | It is essentially an adaptation of suggestions made by J. C. Griffiths | Pennsylvania State University for obtaining representative samples of heterogeneous materials. These suggestions the author gratefully ac knowledges. The method consists of the following steps: (1) In the desired reach of the stream a grid system is established either by pacing or with actual lines | The size of the grid is determined by the length of reach which the sampler desires to describe. This may include both a riffle and a pool, a riffle alone | or a pool alone. If compari- sons are to be made between reaches , the sampler must obviously be consistent in his choice of the length of reach to be included in the sample. (2) After each establishing the grid which can be done by a pacing traverse as the sampler picks up pebble 100 individual pebbles are picked up from the bed. ( | The sampling is probably less subjective when lines or tapes rather than pacing are used to fix the individual sampling points.) Randomness in the selection of each pebble can only be obtained if the sampler tries not to look at the bed as he picks up each pebble. The author 's practice is to draw each pebble from beneath the tip of the toe of his boot. (3 ) The intermediate axis of each pebble is measured. The limitations of measuring small individual pebbles such as sand sizes will be discussed below 1 4 I Unless the actual diameters are of interest, a rule or scale can be designed showing class limits only and each pebble tallied within a grade class immediately | For this purpose the Went worth scale is probably the most useful 1. ( 5 a With the pebbles placed in the proper classes | it is a simple matter to plot a frequency distribution of the sample | This plot is further simplified if the Wentworth size classes are denoted by the d notation r KRUMBEIN 1936] in which d = - 10g2 diameter in mm I Using this logarithmic scale the frequency distribution can be plotted on arithmetic coordinate paper (Fig. 1). Having plotted cumulative frequency curves for the distribution | the median diameter or other desired parameters can readily be determined in the field I INMAN 19521. The paragraphs which follow include observations on the present range of the experimental data a comparison of the results of this procedure with the results produced by other sampling methods | and a brief analysis of the reproducibility of the sample obtained from a given reach by one or more operators. 951 "

These sorting values are lower on the whole than those listed by KRUMBEIN [1942] for comparable (pos sibly finer ) gravels. Although it is conceivable that this method of sampling produces an apparent uniformity in the sample, the range of sorting found in the sediments thus far studied indicates that such a bias if | present, is not significant : Comparison with other methods of sampling and analysis - 1 It is interesting to compare samples deter mined from pebble counts with samples of the same material analyzed by sieving and weighing As the example in Figure 3 shows 3, although the shapes of the curves are similar | the median diam eter of the sample determined by the author 's number frequency method is considerably larger than the median diameter of the sieved sample. The consistency of this relationship has been demons - trated by several analyses | The relationship is the reverse of the one we would expect if the com parison consisted simply of counting pebbles versus weighing the amounts of material in each sieve class from precisely the same sample. In the present instance : however | it is apparently the sam pling procedure rather than the method of analysis which produces the discrepancy in median grain size The sample obtained from the grid represents the areal distribution of material on the bed. Each point sample actually represents a portion of the bed surface. distribution If,for example | the sample of 100 stones contains ten in class 32-64 mm | the plotted frequency actually shows that ten per cent of the surface area sampled is covered by material in the class 32-64 mm The distributions in Figure 3, therefore | represent analyses of samples taken from the same reach by two entirely different methods. The difference stems from the fact that the sieved sam ple represents a scoop of material obtained from one or more locations on the bed. If the bed con tains coarse material . to be representative each sample must weigh in the neighborhood of 200 300 pounds. As a rule | in the absence of a the dredge capable of obtaining a huge sample covering a wide surface area of bed . we obtain for sieve analysis a non -repr esentative sample from se- lected spots which contains a preponderance of fine material. It is the author's opinion that in most instances this defect in sampling is insur mountable if a volumetric analysis is made. "

No systematic differences with position were observed 1 and | as before, the data showed no systematic variation within individual size classes = that is, the error of variation in sampling did not change systematically with change in grain sizes. The data from Watts Branch and from Mines Run suggest that an individual operator can repeat his sampling per formance.

GORDON WOLMAN [Trans AGU V. | | 35 6l Within the range of roundness normally encountered in river studies | there is little or no error introduced by the possibility of different samplers measuring different intermediate axes. Limitations of the sampling procedure a- The principal limitation thus far encountered in prac tice is the inability to measure accurately the fine particles. Two to four mm is about the smallest size which can be measured in the field. | When the proportion of fine material is small, the smalle sizes may be lumped together or measured roughly in separate grades. Either system produces little change in the final result * Where fine material predominates | a sampling method such as this | which provides an areal coverage of the bed | requires both a sampler capable of drawing a single or a limited number of grains from the stream bed and a calibrated magnifying glass which will permit measurements of fine particles in the field The difficulty of bed sampling by hand in deep water is a second limitation of the method | Thus far no satisfactory mechanical sampler has been developed for coarse material. The method is workable , however | where the water is several feet deep X and thus the importance of this limitation which is common to all kinds of sampling beneath flowing water / is at least reduced | Although it may not be a permanent one | the fact that the areal sampling procedure described here produces results | which are not directly comparable to the results previously obtained by bulk sampling and analysis of samples by weight | | is something of a drawback Additional work along the lines described by MARSCHNER [1953] may make it possible to convert from one system to another It is important to remember | however | that conversion is only possible | or for that matter useful. where the samples themselves have equal validity | The primary significance of the sampling pro cedure suggested here is the fact that it gives a more representative sample 2 and hence a different one from those customarily obtained from river beds. Conclusion - - The principal advantages and disadvantages of the areal sampling procedure de- scribed here can be summarized as follows. In its favor are * ( (1) it is simple to perform and in- | deed it is 'possible in situations where flowing water and coarse material make other methods almost impossible P ( 2 the sampling method provides a reasonably representative sample of an entire reachof the stream = and (3) a sufficient range of sizes can be measured to permit some stand . ardization of methods | making possible comparison of results obtained in studies of hydraulic rough ness in one place with those obtained elsewhere | Its primary disadvantage at present is the inability to handle fine material.
